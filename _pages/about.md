Hello! I will become the third year PhD student at Robotics Institute, School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by  <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gxoPfIYAAAAJ&hl=de'> Professor. Sebastian Scherer</a>. 

I am grateful to have wonderful mentors including <a href='http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kaess/'> Professor. Michael Kaess</a> and <a href='https://frc.ri.cmu.edu/~zhangji/'> Professor. Ji Zhang</a>.

Before coming to CMU, I was supervised by Professor Zheng Fang and received my Master's degree from Northeastern University.

I was served as a SLAM investigator of Team Explorer competing in the DARPA Subterranean Challenge. I developed [Super Odometry](https://superodometry.com/) for Team Exlporer, which are adopted as important methods to acheive state estimation. I was also main organizer for 
[Tartan SLAM Series ](https://theairlab.org/tartanslamseries/) and  [ICCV Robot Learning and SLAM WorkShop](https://superodometry.com/iccv23).

I am focusing on the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and 3D recontruction in challenging environments. 

**For more details about my research, please visit [superodometry.com](https://superodometry.com/)**
